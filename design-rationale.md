### Target Users
The primary target users are:
•	Couples planning weddings (Age 22–35)
•	Families planning birthday or special events
•	Corporate clients organizing events
•	Users searching photography services.

### Layout Structure
The website follows a clear, conversion-focused structure:
-Homepage
 Guides them clearly toward taking action like booking or contacting you.
-Social Proof page
 Shows the social proof for trust gaining.
-Service Page 
 This reduces confusion and answers questions before users leave the page.
-Contact Page
 The contact page removes distractions and focuses on enquiry submission.

### UX Decisions
Several UX strategies were implemented:
Clear Value Proposition
The hero section clearly states what the studio offers and includes a strong CTA above the fold.
Multiple CTA Placements
Primary CTA buttons like:
•	“Book Your Date”
are strategically placed across sections to increase action opportunities.
Social Proof
Trust indicators such as:
•	500+ Events Covered
•	4.9 Rating
•	Testimonials
build credibility and reduce hesitation.

### How the Design Improves Conversions
The design improves conversions through:
Clear Navigation
Users can quickly move from homepage to service page to contact page without confusion.
Benefit-Driven CTAs
Instead of generic “Submit,” action-oriented CTAs like “Get Free Quote” encourage engagement.
Visual Hierarchy
Headings, spacing, and contrast guide the user's attention toward key actions.
Reduced Cognitive Load
Clean layout, limited colour palette, and structured content make information easy to scan.
Trust & Reassurance
Ratings, testimonials, and response-time assurance reduce fear of contacting.
